#						BIIS Generation
#============================

This repo contains all the scripts used for the generation of BIIS.

They are currently unorganised and are not automated.

Future work will involve orgainsing this into sections, and automating, so one set of inputs can be provided
requiring only a couple of lines of code edited, before the full model can be run.

For information on the scripts please contact me. For provision of data please contact me.

Note these scripts, and associated output datasets can be used for academic work only when permission has been 
explicitly granted. 

Permission is not given for commercial use. Contact me for further details.
